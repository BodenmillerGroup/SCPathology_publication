The Single-Cell Pathology Landscape of Breast Cancer Reveals Intra-Tumor Cellular Organization and Novel Subgroups

This repository contains all code used to produce the results of this publication. Some early analysis steps were performed in Matlab due to the single-cell data being extracted using histoCAT. Therefore, the Matlab scripts assume that the histoCAT session data is loaded. Downstream single-cell analysis was performed using R and all input data is available on link.
